# cargo-cost-explorer

Gmail doesn't have a way to bulk download into `.elm` files.  You'll need to use some e-mail client or utility to accomplish that.

* Go to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/Aracki/cargo-cost-explorer`
* Put all `CarGo_x.eml` files into directory called `all_emails`
* Change the the hardcoded year within `main.go`
* `go build`
* Run binary
